## Scope Review

JUP-019 remains limited to repo-local corpus definition, manifest metadata, documentation, and structural validation. The implementation does not change backend, processor, frontend, cloud infrastructure, database, queue, pgvector, model-provider, embeddings, semantic retrieval, LiteLLM/OpenRouter integration, UI behavior, Azure API consumption, or final citation rendering.

## ADR Applicability

ADR not applicable. This change defines a repo-local corpus contract and validation command for the MVP, but it does not change service boundaries, runtime architecture, persistence, queues, vector-store behavior, auth/security, tenancy enforcement, external providers, or a durable runtime RAG architecture decision.
